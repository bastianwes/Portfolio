  "introductionText": "We have written this privacy policy (version 18.01.2024-312704506) to explain to you, in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as the responsible party - and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) - process, will process in the future and what legal options you have. The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral. In short: We provide you with comprehensive information about the data we process about you. Data protection declarations usually sound very technical and use legal terms. This privacy policy, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. As far as it is conducive to transparency, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links to further information are provided and graphics are used. We are thus informing you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is an appropriate legal basis. This is certainly not possible if you provide explanations that are as brief, unclear and legal and technical as possible, as is often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and perhaps there is some information there that you did not know before. If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the imprint, follow the existing links and look at further information on third-party websites. You can of course also find our contact details in the imprint.",

By personal data we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill for our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes: all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate social media presences and email communication mobile apps for smartphones and other devices. In short: The privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner in the company via the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.",

As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016. You can of course read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the access to EU law, at",
  "legalBasisTextContinue": ", the access to EU law. We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies: Consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of the data you entered on a contact form. Contract (Article 6 paragraph 1 letter b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you. If, for example, we conclude a purchase agreement with you, we need personal information in advance. Legal obligation (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data. Legitimate interests (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest. Other conditions such as the taking of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of public authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not generally apply to us. If such a legal basis should be applicable, it will be indicated at the appropriate point. In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply: In Austria, this is the Federal Law on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act), or DSG for short. In Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act, or BDSG for short, applies. If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.",

In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose no longer applies, for example for accounting purposes. If you wish your data to be deleted or withdraw your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as quickly as possible and unless there is an obligation to store it.

  "dataProtectionText": "In accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, we inform you of the following rights you are entitled to in order to ensure fair and transparent data processing: According to Article 15 of the GDPR, you have the right to know whether we process data about you. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to know the following information: for what purpose we carry out the processing; the categories, i.e. the types of data that are processed; who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed; how long the data is stored; the existence of the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing; that you can complain to a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below); the origin of the data if we did not collect it from you; whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated to create a personal profile of you. According to Article 16 of the GDPR, you have the right to rectification of the data, which means that we must correct data if you find errors. According to Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”), which specifically means that you can request that your data be erased. According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means that we may only store the data but not use it any further. According to Article 20 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we will provide you with your data in a common format upon request. According to Article 21 GDPR, you have a right of objection, which, once enforced, entails a change in processing. If the processing of your data is based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection. If data is used to conduct direct advertising, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may no longer use your data for direct marketing after this. If data is used to carry out profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may no longer use your data for profiling after that. According to Article 22 GDPR, you may have the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing (e.g. profiling). According to Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to complain. This means that you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the processing of personal data violates the GDPR. In short: you have rights - do not hesitate to contact the responsible body listed above! If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or that your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. For Austria, this is the data protection authority, whose website you can find at",
